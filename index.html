       <p>John Townes Van Zandt (March 7, 1944 â€“ January 1, 1997) was an American singer-songwriter. 
        He wrote numerous songs, such as "Pancho and Lefty", "For the Sake of the Song", "If I Needed 
        You", "Tecumseh Valley", "Tower Song", "Rex's Blues", and "To Live Is to Fly", that are widely 
        considered masterpieces of American songwriting. His musical style has often been described as 
        melancholic and features rich, poetic lyrics. During his early years, Van Zandt was respected 
        for his guitar playing and fingerpicking ability. Much of Van Zandt's life was spent touring 
        various dive bars, often living in cheap motel rooms and backwoods cabins. For much of the 
        1970s, he lived in a simple shack without electricity or a telephone.</p>
       
       <p>He suffered from a series of drug addictions and alcoholism, and was given a psychiatric 
        diagnosis of bipolar disorder. When he was young, the now-discredited insulin shock therapy 
        erased much of his long-term memory. Van Zandt died on New Year's Day 1997 from cardiac 
        arrythmia caused by health problems stemming from years of substance abuse. A revival of 
        interest in Van Zandt blossomed in the 2000s. During the decade, two books, a documentary 
        film (Be Here to Love Me), and numerous magazine articles were written about him.</p>
